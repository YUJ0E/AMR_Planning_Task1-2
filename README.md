### Run
After pip/conda install these libraries, you could directly run all the cells, and the .txt file of the all cells will be saved in the `'./data'` folder in the form of 'start_position_end_position.txt'.
For tasks 1 & 2, we employed two different methods, placed in separate code cells, and annotated them in markdown cells.
